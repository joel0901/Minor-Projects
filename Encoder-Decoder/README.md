# Encoder - Decoder 

1.Train a Autoencoder network till 20th epoch and run inference on at least 5 test images.Visualize features at bottleneck and submit the screenshots of test imagesand visualization of features at bottleneck as images.

2.Modify the Autoencoder network by including convolution layer (1 or 2) in encoder part. For the decoder part you are free to include only linear layeror deconvolution layer or combination of both. Train the modified networktill 20th epoch and submit screenshots of inferences (on 2 images). Submitthe code as ipynb file.
