# K-Means clustering

Write a program to cluster the given set of points using K-means. Consider, K=3, clusters.
Consider Euclidean distance as the distance measure. Randomly initialize a cluster mean as
one of the data points. Iterate for 10 iterations.

a) After iterations are over, print the final cluster means for each of the clusters. Use the
ground truth cluster label present in the data set to compute and print the Jacquard
distance of the obtained clusters with the ground truth clusters for each of the three
clusters.

b) Plot the final clusters using a scatter plot and any 2 features at a time.

c) Bonus: Modify the code to initialize the cluster centres using the concept of
KMeans++, i.e choose the first centre randomly then the second centre will be the
point farthest away from the 1st centre and similarly initialize the 3rd centre keeping
into account its distance from 1st and the 2nd centre.


Note:
1) Donâ€™t use any inbuilt library for performing K-Means clustering. Ex scikit-learn.
However, you are allowed to use Numpy and pandas for data handling.

2) Avoid Hardcoding wherever possible, use global variables for changeable
parameters.

3) The code should be well documented/commented along with an explanation of each
function used.

4) Code will be evaluated on the basis of readability, result, and approach. Any kind of
plagiarism will be highly penalized.
