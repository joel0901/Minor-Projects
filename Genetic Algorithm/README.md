# Genetic Algorithm (from scratch)

Program a complete genetic algorithm using PYTHON to maximize the
number of 1â€™s in a bit string of length 20. Thus our chromosomes will be
binary strings of length 20, and the optimal chromosome that we are
searching for is [11111111111111111111] .


Start with an initial population size of 200 chromosomes, select the best
100 according to the fitness score. From those 100 chromosomes make 50
pairs and do one-point crossover as well as uniform crossover for every
pair to get a population of 200 again. Implant mutations in the resultant
chromosomes with the given bit mutation rate.

Repeat the above procedure for the given number of iterations.


### Given :

fitness function = sum of the bits in the chromosomes

Size of the population = 200 chromosomes

Bit mutation rate = 0.01

Number of iterations (generations) = 300

Location of crossover should be random for one-point crossover


### Implementation details :

Make sure that your code has the following functions -

a) cal_fitness_score(string) = 
This takes a string as input and returns its corresponding fitness
score

b) generate_chromosome() = 
This returns a randomly generated 20 bit string

c) crossover(string1,string2) = 
This takes 2 strings to be mated as inputs and perform uniform as
well as one point crossover between them thus returning 4 child
chromosomes

d) mutate_chromosome(string) = 
This takes a string as input and returns another string after mutating
the input with the given bit mutation rate


### Plot :

(your code must plot the following with clear labels)

Average fitness vs generation

Highest fitness vs generation

Report/print fittest chromosome for each generation

Report/print final fittest chromosome

Also briefly discuss the above results.
