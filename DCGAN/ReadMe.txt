Here, we are controlling the size of the batch, ie, the no of images in the bacth. We are looking at the following possibile batch sizes: 

1. 128
2. 32

The folder named dcgan_artgallery_A3_32 corresponds to the one with the batch size = 32
Similarly, the folder names dcgan_artgallery_A3_128 corresponds to the one with bacth size = 128.
