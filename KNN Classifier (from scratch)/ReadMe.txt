I have implemented this assignment using Google Colab. I have attached both the .ipynb and .py file

When using Google colab, dont forget to add train.csv and test.csv to to a new folder. It can be done as follows: 

1. !mkdir cancer(any name will do)
2. # Upload train.csv and test.csv
3. cd cancer

Now the code will be good to run
There will be a compilation time of around 30-60 seconds for each case.


Report.pdf conatins the images of the test accuracies and the conclusions drawn from it. All the images are also provided under the folder "Images". The images have been named in accordance with the distance metric and the k value.
