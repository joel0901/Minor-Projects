# Advanced Computer Vision using MediaPipe

We will be using the MediaPipe library by Google for some fun and interesting projects in Computer Vision. We will be looking at 5 projects:


### 1. Gesture Volume Control
Using the system's webcam and our hand to increase and decrease the volume of our system


### 2. Finger Counter
Using the system's webcam to show how many fingers we are holding up


### 3. AI Personal Trainer
Using the system's webcam to tell the user how many curls they have done based on angle calculation


### 4. Virtual Painter 
Using our hands to draw on our system's screen using the system's webcam


### 5. AI Virtual Mouse
Using our hand as a mouse to be used on our system by turning on the system's webcam
