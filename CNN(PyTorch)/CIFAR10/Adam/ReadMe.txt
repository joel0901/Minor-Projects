We are using three different learning rates to see the effect on the accuracy. The ones used are :

1. Lr = 0.001
2. Lr = 0.005
3. Lr = 0.01

We see that, as the learning rate increases, the accuracy decreses. It drastically reduces as it increases more and more. (It went from 69.22 to 10.0 in my iteration)
