# CNN using PyTorch

Design a Convolutional Neural Network. Use an extra layer of convolution, relu, and maxpool and assess the performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets for 20 epochs. You are free to choose the learning rate and the optimiser type. Any other parameter like kernel size, stride, etc is also entirely up to the choice of the experimenter.
CIFAR-10 dataset can be loaded similarly from PyTorchâ€™s available functions.
